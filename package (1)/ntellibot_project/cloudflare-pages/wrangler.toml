# Cloudflare Pages Configuration for !ntellibot OSINT Dashboard
# Generated for migration from Netlify Functions to Cloudflare Pages

name = "ntellibot-osint"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Pages Configuration
[pages]
# Build output directory
# Static files are in the root, functions are in functions/
# Cloudflare Pages will automatically serve static files from root
# and route /api/* to functions/ via _worker.js

# Worker Configuration for API routes
[build]
# No build command needed - we're deploying static files + functions
# The functions directory will be processed automatically

# Environment Variables (optional)
# Uncomment and configure as needed
# [env]
# ACLED_API_KEY = ""

# Vars for API functions
# [vars]
# ENV = "production"

# Note: For Cloudflare Pages, the functions directory structure is:
# - functions/api/*.js -> mapped to /api/* endpoints
# - _worker.js in functions/ -> handles routing and can import other functions
#
# For this project, we're using the single _worker.js approach
# which imports and routes to individual API handlers.
